# ProntoCine
I built this project to refactor my old project ADDICINE, both site have the same HTML/CSS i didn't change anything because i want to focus myself on learning MVCX pattern, i learn how to work with an API pretty easl.
Learn the MVC model was a littlez bit harder but in the end i learn what does it work and how to write it, i need more practice but i can do it.


# Why i used cURL
To build this project i used CURL to download data and wich can communicate with an API, i used CURL cause i want to privilage PHP over Javcascript and that's why i don't used Axios/ajax/fetch.
In my Controllers i have all the data i get from curling from the API and i render the view.
In my Model i have my class to initiate curl and return trhe data.
In my views i have all my templates to show what i returned in my controllers.

# How to install & run the Project
First of you need is download the project, to create a .env file in the views table and write into it your API key.
Then you need to donwload the SSL certificate from the API site and put it in the models folder.
Now if you have XAMPP or WAMP you need to put it on and go on your localhost and search for www folder where you put your project go into yout project, go into app folder, go into views folder and then show the index.php in the Movies folder.
If you want change the style you need to download node and then run the command to run sass and change the scss file.
